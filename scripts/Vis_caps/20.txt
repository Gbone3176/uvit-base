- **Mediastinum Shape and Position:** The mediastinal contours appear normal, indicating no abnormal widening.
- **Diaphragm:** The diaphragm appears sharp and free from any abnormal elevation.
- **Pleural Space:** The pleural spaces on either side are clear and free from any fluid accumulation or thickening.
