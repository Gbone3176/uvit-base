This chest X-ray image showcases key features consistent with pneumothorax. The heart appears to be in a central position with normal size and shape. The left lung field displays decreased lung volume and increased radiolucency, indicating the presence of air without lung markings. The right lung field shows normal lung markings and appropriate volume. The bony structure, including the ribs and the spine, appears intact without any fractures. The mediastinum is centered, and the diaphragm looks unremarkable. The pleural spaces and the surrounding soft tissue structures appear normal.
