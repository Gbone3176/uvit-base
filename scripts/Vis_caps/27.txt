The X-ray shows a chest with enlarged cardiac silhouette, suggesting potential cardiomegaly. Both lung fields appear collapsed, and there's evidence of fluid accumulation in the pleural space, consistent with an enlarged cardiac silhouette. The diaphragm is clearly seen and appears normal. The ribs and vertebral column appear intact without visible fractures. Pulmonary vessels are notable, and the mediastinal structures are central and normally positioned. There are no visible masses, nodules, or distinct signs of pneumonia, consolidation, or emphysema. The overall imaging suggests a potential effusion and pulmonary compression.
