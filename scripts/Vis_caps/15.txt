3. **Bony Fractures**: The ribs and spine appear intact without any visible fractures.
4. **Pulmonary Patterns and Vessels**: The pulmonary vasculature is regular, without signs of vascular congestion, large vascular anomalies, or pulmonary embolism.
5. **Mediastinum Shape and Position**: The mediastinum maintains its normal shape and position without signs of deviation.
6. **Diaphragm**: The diaphragm contours are smooth and well-defined, with no irregularities or elevation indicating potential effusion or diaphragmatic hernia.
7. **Pleural Space**: The pleural cavities appear clear without any evidence of pleural effusion, thickening, or pneumothorax.
