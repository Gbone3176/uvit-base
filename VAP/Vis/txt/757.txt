The chest X-ray appears to be normal, with no findings. The chest symmetry and bone structure alignment are within normal limits, and there are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within normal ranges. The image is consistent with RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
