In the chest X-ray image, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are detected. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits. The chest X-ray findings are in accordance with RSNA standards, which require a technical factors assessment, followed by an anatomic survey, and then metric-verified normal observations. Artifact notes are also provided to account for any potential artifacts or technical issues that may have affected the image.
