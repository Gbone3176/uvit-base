In this chest X-ray, the clavicle-spine distance ratio is 0.69, and the lung transparency gradients are 4/4. These measurements are taken according to the RSNA standards for reporting chest X-rays. The image shows normal chest symmetry and bone structure alignment, with no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The visual measurements and findings are consistent with the metric-verified normal observations.
