In this chest X-ray, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal, with no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within normal ranges, according to the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) standards. The image is free of artifacts, and the anatomic survey and metric-verified normal observations are in agreement.
