In the chest X-ray image, the symmetry of the chest is observed, and the bone structure alignment is also noted. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are detected in the image. Additionally, the clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are measured. The image is structured according to the RSNA standards, with technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes. It is important to remember that no conclusions or recommendations should be provided in the radiology report.
