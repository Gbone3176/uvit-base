The chest X-ray appears to be normal, as it shows chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits. The structure findings are based on the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
