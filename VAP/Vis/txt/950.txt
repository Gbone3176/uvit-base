The chest X-ray image shows symmetrical chest wall and bone structure alignment, with no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 0.8, and the lung transparency gradients are 2/5. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
