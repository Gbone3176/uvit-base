The chest X-ray shows no findings. The chest is symmetric, with the clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients appearing normal. The image does not reveal any signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The findings are structured according to the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
