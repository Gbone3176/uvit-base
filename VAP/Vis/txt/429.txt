The chest X-ray appears to have normal symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are normal, and the lung transparency gradients are within the expected range. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for a normal chest X-ray.
