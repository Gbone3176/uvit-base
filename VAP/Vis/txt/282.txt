This chest X-ray appears to show normal findings, as it is described as having no findings. The image demonstrates chest symmetry and bone structure alignment, with no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within normal limits. The image is structured according to the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
