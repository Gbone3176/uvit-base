The chest X-ray appears to be symmetrical, with normal alignment of the clavicle and spine. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are observed in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within the normal range. The image is of metric-verified normal observations, and no artifacts are present.
