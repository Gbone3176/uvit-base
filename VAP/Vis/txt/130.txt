The chest X-ray appears to be normal, as it shows no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within the normal range, indicating a symmetrical chest and proper alignment of the bone structure. The image is consistent with the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
