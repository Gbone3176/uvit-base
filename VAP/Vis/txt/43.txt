This chest X-ray appears to be normal, as there are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits. The image is in accordance with RSNA standards, with technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes. However, it is important to remember that I cannot provide any conclusions or recommendations based on this image alone.
