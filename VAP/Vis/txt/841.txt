The chest X-ray appears to have normal symmetry and alignment of the chest wall and bone structures. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are observed. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits. The image is consistent with the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
