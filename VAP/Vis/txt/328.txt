The chest X-ray shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures were detected in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients appear to be within normal limits. The findings are in accordance with RSNA standards, with technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
