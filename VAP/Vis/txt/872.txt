The chest X-ray appears to be symmetric and shows proper alignment of the chest wall bones, excluding signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, and fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are all within normal limits, as defined by the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) standards. The image is free of any significant artifacts.
