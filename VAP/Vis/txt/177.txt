In the chest X-ray, the symmetry of the chest is observed, with the bone structure appearing aligned. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are evident in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are measured, and the lung transparency gradients are also observed. The findings are reported according to the standardized reporting system for the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA).
