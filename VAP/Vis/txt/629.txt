The chest X-ray shows good symmetry and alignment of the chest wall bones, with no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios appear to be normal, and the lung transparency gradients are within the expected range. The image is free of any significant artifacts that may interfere with the interpretation.
