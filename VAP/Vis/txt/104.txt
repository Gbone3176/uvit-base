The chest X-ray reveals symmetrical chest structures and bone alignment. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are detected in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are measured at 0.27 and 0.28, and the lung transparency gradients are observed as 2 and 3. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for radiology reporting, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes. It is important to note that no conclusions or recommendations should be drawn from the image.
