In this chest X-ray image, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits. Structure findings are made according to the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
