In this chest X-ray, the image demonstrates normal chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no visible signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients appear to be within normal limits. The findings in the image are consistent with the RSNA standards for chest X-rays, which include assessing technical factors, conducting an anatomic survey, making metric-verified normal observations, and noting any artifacts.
