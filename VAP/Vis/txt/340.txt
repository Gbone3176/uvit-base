In this chest X-ray, the bilateral clavicle-spine distance ratios appear to be normal. The lung transparency gradients are also within the normal range. The image does not show any signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The visual measurements of the clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are consistent with the normal anatomy and are metric-verified. No artifacts were detected in the image.
