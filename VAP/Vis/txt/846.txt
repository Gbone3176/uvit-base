In this chest X-ray, the clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients appear to be normal. The image does not show any signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The visual measurements are consistent with the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes. It is important to remember that I cannot provide any conclusions or recommendations based on this image.
