In this chest X-ray image, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal, with no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. Additionally, the clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within the normal range, as per RSNA standards. The image shows no artifacts, and the metric-verified normal observations are consistent with the expected findings for a healthy chest X-ray.
