This chest X-ray shows good symmetry and alignment of the chest structures. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are present in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients appear normal, as do the other structures in the image. The findings in this chest X-ray are consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
