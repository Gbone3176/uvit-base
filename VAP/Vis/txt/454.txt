The chest X-ray shows good symmetry and alignment of the chest wall, with no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients appear normal. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for chest X-ray imaging.
