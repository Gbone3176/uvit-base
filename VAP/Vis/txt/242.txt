The chest X-ray appears to have normal symmetry and alignment of the chest bones. The image does not show any signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits. The structure findings of the chest X-ray are in agreement with the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
