In this chest X-ray, the clavicle-spine distance ratio is 2.3, and the lung transparency gradients show 1+/1+. The image exhibits normal alignment of the chest symmetry and bone structures, with no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The visual measurements are consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
