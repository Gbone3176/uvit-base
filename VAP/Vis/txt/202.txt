The chest X-ray appears to show normal anatomy and symmetry. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 0.65, and the lung transparency gradients are normal. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for a normal chest X-ray.
