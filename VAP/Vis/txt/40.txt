In this chest X-ray, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures were observed. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 0.87, and the lung transparency gradients are 4/4. These findings are consistent with the normal anatomy and structure of the chest. The image is metric-verified normal, according to RSNA standards.
