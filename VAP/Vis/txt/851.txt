The chest X-ray shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.47, and the lung transparency gradients are 0.8. The structure findings are based on the RSNA standards for chest X-rays, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
