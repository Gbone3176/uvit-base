The chest X-ray shows chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.58, and the lung transparency gradients are 0.90 (right lung) and 0.88 (left lung). These findings are consistent with normal anatomy and are metric-verified normal observations, according to the RSNA standards.
