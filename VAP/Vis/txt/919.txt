The chest X-ray appears to be symmetrical, with the bone structure of the clavicles and spine aligned. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures were observed in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.57, 0.57, 0.57, and 0.56, respectively. The lung transparency gradients are 0.93, 0.93, 0.93, and 0.93, respectively. These findings are consistent with normal observations, as described in the RSNA standards.
