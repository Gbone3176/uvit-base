This chest X-ray demonstrates normal chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are detected in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are measured at 0.57, and the lung transparency gradients are assessed as 0.96. These measurements are based on the RSNA standards and are considered normal.
