The chest X-ray shows normal chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within the normal range, and the lung transparency gradients are also normal. The image is in compliance with RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
