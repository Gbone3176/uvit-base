This chest X-ray shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 1.1, and the lung transparency gradients are 4+. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for a normal chest X-ray.
