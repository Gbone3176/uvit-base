In this chest X-ray, the chest appears to be symmetric, with the bone structure alignment being normal. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are observed in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within normal limits, according to the RSNA standards. The visual measurements and structure findings are metric-verified normal observations. Artifact notes are provided to account for any potential image distortions or artifacts that may have affected the evaluation of the chest X-ray.
