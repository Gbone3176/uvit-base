In the chest X-ray image, we first observe symmetry in the chest and alignment of bone structures. There are no visible signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.40 and 0.42, and the lung transparency gradients are consistent with the RSNA standards. The image is metric-verified normal, and no artifacts were noted.
