In this chest X-ray, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal, with no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within the normal range, and the lung transparency gradients are consistent with the expected normal values. These findings indicate that the chest X-ray is within normal limits, according to the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
