In this chest X-ray, the clavicle-spine distance ratio is 4.0, and the lung transparency gradients are 4.0. These measurements are considered within normal limits. The image shows no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The anatomic survey appears to be normal, and the metric-verified normal observations are consistent with the RSNA standards.
