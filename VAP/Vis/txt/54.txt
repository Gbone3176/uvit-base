In this chest X-ray image, the chest appears to have good symmetry and alignment of the bone structures. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are observed. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients are consistent with the anatomic survey standards. The image is metric-verified normal, and there are no artifact notes.
