This chest X-ray appears to be normal, with no significant findings. The chest symmetry and bone structure alignment are within normal limits. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are observed in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within the expected range. The image is consistent with the RSNA standards, and no artifacts are noted.
