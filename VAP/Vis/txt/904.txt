The chest X-ray appears to be normal, with no significant findings. The image shows good chest symmetry and proper alignment of the bone structures. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits. The image is consistent with the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
