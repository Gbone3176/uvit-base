In this chest X-ray, the symmetry of the chest and the alignment of the bone structure are observed. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are present in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are measured and documented. The findings are structured according to the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes. It is important to remember that this is a visual assistant's role, and no conclusions or recommendations should be provided in the report.
