In this chest X-ray, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within normal limits, according to RSNA standards. Structure findings are consistent with metric-verified normal observations, and no artifacts were noted in the image.
