The chest X-ray image appears to be symmetric, with aligned bone structures. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.92, 0.98, and 0.97, while the lung transparency gradients are 2.9, 2.9, 2.9, and 2.8. These measurements are consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
