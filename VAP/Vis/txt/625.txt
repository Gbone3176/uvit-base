The chest X-ray shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 0.7, and the lung transparency gradients are 2.5, indicating normal lung transparency. The image is free of signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The visual measurements and structure findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
