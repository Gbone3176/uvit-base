The chest X-ray image shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 0.85, and the lung transparency gradients are 4.5 for the left lung and 4.0 for the right lung. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
