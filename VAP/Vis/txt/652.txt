The chest X-ray shows good symmetry of the chest bones, with the clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients in normal ranges. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are observed. The image is in good alignment with the RSNA standards for radiology reporting, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
