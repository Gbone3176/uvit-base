The chest X-ray appears to be normal, with no evidence of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are all within normal limits. The image is consistent with the RSNA standards for radiology reporting, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
