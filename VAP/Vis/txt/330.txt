The chest X-ray image shows chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.39, 0.35, and 0.33, respectively. The lung transparency gradients are 2, 2, 2, and 2. These findings are consistent with normal observations according to RSNA standards.
