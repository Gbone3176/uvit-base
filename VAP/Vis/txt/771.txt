In this chest X-ray, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are measured using the 4th rib as the reference point. The lung transparency gradients are also observed and reported. The image is structured according to the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes. However, it is important to note that no conclusions or recommendations are provided in this report.
