In this chest X-ray, the chest appears to be symmetric, and the bone structure alignment is also normal. The image does not show any signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are normal, with a clavicle-spine ratio of 1.2, and the lung transparency gradients are also within normal limits. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for radiology reports, which emphasize technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
