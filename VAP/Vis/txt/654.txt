The chest X-ray appears to have good symmetry and bone structure alignment. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are present in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients are within the expected range. The image is consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes. Keep in mind that I am a visual assistant and not a medical professional, so I cannot provide any conclusions or recommendations based on the image.
