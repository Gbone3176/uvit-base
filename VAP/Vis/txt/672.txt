This chest X-ray image shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.40, and the lung transparency gradients are 2.0. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for reporting chest X-rays, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
