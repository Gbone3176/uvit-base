The chest X-ray appears to be symmetrical, with proper alignment of the chest wall bones. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are observed in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits. The findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for chest X-ray reports, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
