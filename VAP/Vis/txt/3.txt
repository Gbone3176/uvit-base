The chest X-ray appears to be within normal limits, as there is no evidence of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within normal ranges. The image is taken according to the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
