In this chest X-ray, chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits. The structure findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for chest X-rays.
