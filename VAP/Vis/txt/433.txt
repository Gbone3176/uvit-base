This chest X-ray demonstrates good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures observed in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.33 for the right clavicle and 0.32 for the left clavicle, which are within normal limits. The lung transparency gradients are 2.2 for the right lung and 2.1 for the left lung, indicating normal lung transparency. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
