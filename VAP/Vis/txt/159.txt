The chest X-ray appears to show normal findings. The image demonstrates symmetry and alignment of the chest structures, including the clavicles and spine. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits. The image is consistent with the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
