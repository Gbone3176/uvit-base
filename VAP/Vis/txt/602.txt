The chest X-ray appears to be normal, as there are no findings of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within normal limits. The image is well-aligned, and the technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes are all within the expected range for a normal chest X-ray.
