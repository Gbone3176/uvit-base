The chest X-ray image appears to be symmetrical with good alignment of the clavicle and spine. There are no visible signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits. The structure findings follow the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
