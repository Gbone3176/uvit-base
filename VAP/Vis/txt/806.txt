The chest X-ray shows good symmetry and alignment of the chest wall bones. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are detected in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients indicate no significant abnormalities. These findings are in agreement with the RSNA standards for radiology reporting, which emphasize technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
