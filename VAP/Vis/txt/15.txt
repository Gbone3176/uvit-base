This chest X-ray appears to be normal, as it shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are evident in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within normal limits. The image is structured according to the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) standards, with technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
