The chest X-ray image shows good symmetry and alignment of the chest wall bones. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.95, and the lung transparency gradients are 5.6. These findings are in agreement with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, and metric-verified normal observations.
