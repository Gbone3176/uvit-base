The chest X-ray image shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures were observed in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 0.54, and the lung transparency gradients are 2.5. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
