In this chest X-ray, the overall symmetry and alignment of the chest structures are observed. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients appear to be within normal limits. The findings are in accordance with the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) standards for reporting, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
