In this chest X-ray, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures present in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits, as per RSNA standards. The visual measurements and artifact notes are also normal.
