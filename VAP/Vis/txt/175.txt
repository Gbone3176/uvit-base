The chest X-ray image appears to be symmetric, with the clavicle-spine distance and lung transparency gradients all being metric-verified normal. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. The RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes are all being followed.
