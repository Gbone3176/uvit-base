The chest X-ray appears to be normal, with chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are observed in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits. The findings are consistent with the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
