In this chest X-ray, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal. There are no visible signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 0.62, and the lung transparency gradients are 4. These findings are consistent with normal anatomy and are within the expected range for a healthy individual.
