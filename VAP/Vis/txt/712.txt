The chest X-ray appears to be normal, with no significant findings. The chest symmetry and bone structure alignment are consistent, and there are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits, according to RSNA standards. The image is metric-verified and free of artifacts.
