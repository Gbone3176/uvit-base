The chest X-ray shows good symmetry and alignment of the chest wall and bone structures. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients are also within normal ranges. The structure findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
