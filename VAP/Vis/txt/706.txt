The chest X-ray appears to have normal findings. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within the normal range. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. The overall structure of the chest appears to be in alignment, and the visual measurements are consistent with the RSNA standards.
