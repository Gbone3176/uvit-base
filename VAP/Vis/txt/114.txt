The chest X-ray appears to be symmetrical, with all the bones properly aligned. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits. The findings in the image are consistent with the RSNA standards for a normal chest X-ray.
