The chest X-ray image shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.64 and 0.77, which are within the normal range. Additionally, the lung transparency gradients are 0.53 and 0.68, also indicating normal findings. The overall appearance of the chest X-ray is consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
