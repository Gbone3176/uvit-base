The chest X-ray image shows normal chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients appear to be within normal limits. The image is consistent with the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
