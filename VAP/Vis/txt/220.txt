Chest Symmetry and Bone Structure Alignment: The chest X-ray appears to be symmetric, which means that both sides of the chest are similar in appearance. The bone structures, such as the clavicles and spine, are also well-aligned in the image.

Excluding Signs of Pneumothorax/Effusion/Masses/Fractures: The chest X-ray does not show any signs of pneumothorax (collapsed lung), effusion (fluid accumulation), masses (abnormal growths), or fractures.

Clavicle-Spine Distance Ratios and Lung Transparency Gradients: The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients appear to be within normal limits, which means that the distances between the clavicles and spine, as well as the transparency of the lungs, are consistent with what is typically seen in healthy individuals.

Structuring Findings According to RSNA Standards: The chest X-ray is structured according to the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) standards for reporting diagnostic images. This includes a technical factors section, an anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
