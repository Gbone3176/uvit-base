In this chest X-ray, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures were observed. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within normal limits. The findings are in accordance with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
