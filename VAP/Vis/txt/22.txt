This chest X-ray demonstrates normal chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are present in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 0.6, and the lung transparency gradients are as follows: 100% for the left lung, 100% for the right lung, and 100% for the middle lung. These findings are in accordance with the RSNA standards for chest X-rays, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
