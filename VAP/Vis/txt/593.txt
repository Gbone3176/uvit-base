The chest X-ray appears to be normal, with chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are consistent with normal anatomy, and the lung transparency gradients are within the expected range. The findings are in accordance with the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
