In this chest X-ray, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits. The structure findings are consistent with the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
