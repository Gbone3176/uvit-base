In this chest X-ray, the overall chest symmetry appears to be normal, with the bone structure alignment also appearing to be normal. There are no visible signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within the normal range for the patient's age, sex, and body habitus. The structure findings according to the RSNA standards are as follows:

1. Technical factors: The image is a posteroanterior (PA) view, and the patient is in a standing position.
2. Anatomic survey: The chest X-ray shows the heart, lungs, ribcage, and diaphragm.
3. Metric-verified normal observations: The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within the normal range.
4. Artifact notes: No artifacts are present in the image.
