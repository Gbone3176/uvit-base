In the chest X-ray image, the symmetry of the chest and the alignment of the bone structures are observed. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also examined. The image is structured according to the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes. Keep in mind that it is important not to provide any conclusions or recommendations based on the image.
