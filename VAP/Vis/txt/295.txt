The chest X-ray appears to be normal, with no findings or abnormalities detected. The chest symmetry and bone structure alignment are within normal limits, and there are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within the expected range. The findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for normal chest X-ray images, and no artifacts were identified in the image.
