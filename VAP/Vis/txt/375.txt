In the chest X-ray, the symmetry and alignment of the chest structures appear to be normal, with no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. Additionally, the clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits. The image is in compliance with the RSNA standards, which include a technical factors assessment, an anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
