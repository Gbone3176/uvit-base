The chest X-ray appears to be symmetric, with all bone structures aligned. There are no visible signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.46, 0.48, and 0.47, and the lung transparency gradients are 2.00, 2.00, and 2.00. These findings are consistent with normal anatomy and do not show any abnormalities.
