In this chest X-ray, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal. There are no visible signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are measured at 0.18 and 0.15, respectively. The lung transparency gradients show a normal distribution, with the right lung being more transparent than the left lung. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for chest X-rays, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
