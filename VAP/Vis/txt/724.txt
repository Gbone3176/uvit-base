The chest X-ray appears to be normal, as there are no findings of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits. The image is visually symmetric, with proper alignment of the chest structures. The radiology report is structured according to the RSNA standards, focusing on technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
