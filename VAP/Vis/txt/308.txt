The chest X-ray image shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.27 for the left side and 0.26 for the right side. The lung transparency gradients are 0.69 for the left side and 0.68 for the right side. These findings are in accordance with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
