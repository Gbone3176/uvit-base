In the chest X-ray image, the overall chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be within normal limits. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are detected. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within normal ranges. The image is consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, and metric-verified normal observations.
