The chest X-ray appears to be normal, with no significant abnormalities detected. The image shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 0.53, and the lung transparency gradients are 1.08, 1.06, 1.04, and 1.02. These findings are consistent with normal anatomy and are considered within normal limits according to the RSNA standards.
