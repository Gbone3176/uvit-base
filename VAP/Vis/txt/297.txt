In the radiology report style, the chest X-ray shows chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients appear to be within normal limits. The findings are consistent with the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes. It is important to note that no conclusions or recommendations should be drawn from this image.
