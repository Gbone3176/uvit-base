The chest X-ray appears to be symmetric with normal bone structure alignment. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures were identified in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 0.6, and the lung transparency gradients range from 1.3 to 1.8. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for chest X-ray reporting, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
