This chest X-ray shows normal chest symmetry and alignment of bone structures. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are present in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients appear to be within normal limits, according to the RSNA standards. The image is technically adequate, and no artifacts are noted.
