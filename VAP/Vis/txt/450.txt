The chest X-ray appears to be symmetric, with the clavicle-spine distance ratio at 0.6 and the lung transparency gradients at 1.5. The image does not show any signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The visual measurements are consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
