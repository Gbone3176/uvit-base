The chest X-ray image appears to be symmetric, with proper alignment of the chest wall bones. No signs of pneumothorax, pleural effusion, masses, or fractures were observed in the image. Additionally, the clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients were measured and found to be within normal limits. The image was assessed according to the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
