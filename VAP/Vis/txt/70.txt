In this chest X-ray, the radiologist observed chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There were no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios were 0.95, 0.97, and 0.98, and the lung transparency gradients were 0.85, 0.90, and 0.94. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for chest X-rays, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
