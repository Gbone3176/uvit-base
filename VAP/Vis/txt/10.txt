The chest X-ray appears to be normal, with no significant findings. The chest symmetry and bone structure alignment are within the expected range, and there are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within the normal range. The visual measurements of these distances and gradients are consistent with the RSNA standards for normal chest X-rays. No artifacts were observed in the image.
