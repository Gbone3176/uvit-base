The chest X-ray image shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients appear to be within normal limits. The findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for radiology reports, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
