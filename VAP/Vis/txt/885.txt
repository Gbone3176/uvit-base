The chest X-ray appears to be symmetric, with normal alignment of the chest wall bones. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within normal limits. The image is consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
