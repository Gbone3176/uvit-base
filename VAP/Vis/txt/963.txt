This chest X-ray is described as having good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. The image does not show any signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients appear to be normal. The findings in this chest X-ray are consistent with the RSNA standards for radiology reports, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
