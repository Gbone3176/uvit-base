The chest X-ray image demonstrates normal chest symmetry and bone structure alignment, with no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-to-spine distance ratio is 0.5, and the lung transparency gradients are observed as follows: 5% in the right upper lobe, 10% in the right middle lobe, 20% in the right lower lobe, 10% in the left upper lobe, 20% in the left middle lobe, and 30% in the left lower lobe. These findings are in accordance with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
