The chest X-ray appears to be symmetric in terms of the alignment of the chest wall and bone structures. The image does not show any signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients appear normal. The lung fields show normal anatomic survey, with metric-verified normal observations. The image is free of significant artifacts.
