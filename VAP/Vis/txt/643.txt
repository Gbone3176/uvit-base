In this chest X-ray, the patient's chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal, excluding signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within normal limits. The image is in good agreement with RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes. It is important to note that no conclusions or recommendations should be drawn from this image alone.
