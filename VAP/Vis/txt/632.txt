This chest X-ray appears to be symmetric, with the clavicle-spine distance ratio and lung transparency gradients within normal limits. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures were observed in the image. The structure findings are consistent with the standards set by the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA).
