The chest X-ray appears to be symmetric, with normal alignment of the clavicle and spine. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 0.9, and the lung transparency gradients are 2.5. These findings are consistent with normal anatomy and are considered metric-verified normal observations according to RSNA standards.
