In this chest X-ray, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. 

The clavicle-spine distance ratios, which are the measurements of the distance between the clavicle and the spine, are within normal limits. The lung transparency gradients, which indicate the degree of transparency of the lung tissue, are also within normal limits. 

These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for a normal chest X-ray. Keep in mind that as a visual assistant, I am not authorized to provide any conclusions or recommendations based on the image.
