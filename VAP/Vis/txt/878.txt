The chest X-ray shows normal chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 0.8, and the lung transparency gradients are 2.0. The findings in the image are consistent with the RSNA standards for normal anatomy and lung transparency. No artifacts were detected in the image.
