The chest X-ray appears to be symmetric and aligned with the bone structure. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within normal limits. The findings in the image are consistent with the RSNA standards for a normal chest X-ray, with no technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
