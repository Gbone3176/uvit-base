In this chest X-ray, the overall symmetry of the chest and the alignment of the bone structures appear to be normal, with no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients also appear to be within normal limits. The findings in this chest X-ray are consistent with the RSNA standards for radiology reporting, which emphasize technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
