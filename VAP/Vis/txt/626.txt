The chest X-ray image shows good chest symmetry and alignment of the bone structures. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are observed. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within the normal range, and the lung transparency gradients are also within the normal range. The image is consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
