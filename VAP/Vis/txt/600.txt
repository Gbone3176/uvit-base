In the chest X-ray image, the clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.97, 0.96, and 0.97. These measurements are used to assess the alignment of the bone structure. Regarding lung transparency gradients, there is a 0.75 grade decrease in the right upper lobe and a 0.50 grade decrease in the right lower lobe. These findings indicate a reduction in lung transparency, which could be related to fibrosis or other lung abnormalities.
