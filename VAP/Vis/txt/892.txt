The chest X-ray image shows chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.35, and the lung transparency gradients are 0.50. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
