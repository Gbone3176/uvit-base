This chest X-ray demonstrates good symmetry and alignment of the chest wall, including the clavicle-spine distance ratio and lung transparency gradients. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures were identified in the image. The 2:1 clavicle-spine distance ratio and 3:1 lung transparency gradients indicate normal findings. The image was taken using the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
