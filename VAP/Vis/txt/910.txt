The chest X-ray image appears to be symmetric, and the bone structure alignment is also observed. However, it's important to note that there are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. 

The clavicle-spine distance ratios are measured at 4.7 and 4.5, respectively. These measurements are consistent with the normal range, which is approximately 4.5 to 5.0. Additionally, the lung transparency gradients are observed to be 1.5 and 1.8, respectively. These values are within the normal range, which is typically between 1.5 and 2.0.
