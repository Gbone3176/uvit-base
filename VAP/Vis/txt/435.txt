In this chest X-ray, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal. There are no visible signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits. The findings are structured according to the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
