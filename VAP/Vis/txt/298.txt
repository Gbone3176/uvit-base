In this chest X-ray image, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are detected. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients show no significant abnormalities. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for a normal chest X-ray.
