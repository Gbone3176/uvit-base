This chest X-ray appears to be normal, as it shows symmetry and alignment of the chest structures. The image does not reveal any signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits. The findings are in accordance with the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes. Keep in mind that no conclusions or recommendations should be provided based on this image.
