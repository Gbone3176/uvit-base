The chest X-ray appears to be symmetric, with no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within normal limits. The image is in accordance with RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes. It is important to remember that this is a visual assessment and no conclusions or recommendations should be drawn from the image alone.
