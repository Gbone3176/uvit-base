In this chest X-ray, the patient's chest appears to be symmetrical, and the bone structure alignment is also normal. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within the normal range. The findings in this chest X-ray are consistent with the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
