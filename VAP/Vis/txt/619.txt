In this chest X-ray image, the chest appears to be symmetric, with proper alignment of the clavicle and spine. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients demonstrate adequate lung expansion. The findings in this chest X-ray are consistent with RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
