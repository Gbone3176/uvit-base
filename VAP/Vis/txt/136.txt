The chest X-ray shows symmetry of the chest and alignment of the bone structure. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 0.61, and the lung transparency gradients are as follows: 40% for the right lung, 30% for the left lung, and 35% for the middle lung. The findings are in agreement with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
