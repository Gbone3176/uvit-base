The chest X-ray appears to have normal symmetry and bone structure alignment. It shows no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits. The findings are consistent with the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
