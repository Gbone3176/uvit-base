The chest X-ray appears to have good symmetry and alignment of the chest wall bones. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients show no significant abnormalities. The image is consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
