The chest X-ray shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures were detected in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.34 and 0.35, and the lung transparency gradients are 6.5 and 7.0. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
