In the chest X-ray image, there is good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are evident in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.58, and the lung transparency gradients are 1.00. These findings are consistent with a normal chest X-ray, according to the RSNA standards. Artifact notes should be provided if any artifacts are detected in the image.
