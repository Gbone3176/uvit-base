In this chest X-ray image, the chest symmetry is observed, and the bone structure alignment is also noted. However, no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are present in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are measured and recorded, and the lung transparency gradients are observed. The findings are structured according to the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes. It is important to remember that the visual assistant should not provide any conclusions or recommendations based on the image.
