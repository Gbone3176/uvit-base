In this chest X-ray, the bilateral lung fields demonstrate no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are found to be normal. The image is consistent with the RSNA standards for radiology reporting, with technical factors, anatomic survey, and metric-verified normal observations. Artifact notes are also present.
