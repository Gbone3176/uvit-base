The chest X-ray appears to be symmetric, with no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal ranges. The image is in agreement with RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
