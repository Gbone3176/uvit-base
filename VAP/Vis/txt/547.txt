In the chest X-ray, the image appears to show good symmetry and alignment of the chest bones. There are no visible signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits, and the structures are consistent with RSNA standards.
