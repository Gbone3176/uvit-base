In this chest X-ray, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal, with no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within the normal range, as measured by the RSNA standards. The structure findings are explicitly excluded, and no artifacts were noted in the image.
