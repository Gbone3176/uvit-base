The chest X-ray shows normal chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. The image does not show any signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients indicate that the lungs appear clear without any significant abnormalities. The findings are in accordance with the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
