The chest X-ray shows normal chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients are unremarkable. The image is in agreement with RSNA standards, with technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
