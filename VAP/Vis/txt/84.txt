In this chest X-ray, the chest symmetry appears to be normal, with no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are measured and recorded. The lung transparency gradients, which are used to assess the opacity of the lung tissue, are also evaluated. The lung transparency gradients are assessed on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being the most transparent (least opaque) and 5 being the least transparent (most opaque).
