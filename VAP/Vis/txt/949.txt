In the chest X-ray, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits, indicating that the lung tissue appears healthy. The image is consistent with the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
