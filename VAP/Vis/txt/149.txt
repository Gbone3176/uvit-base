The chest X-ray image shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment, with no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 4.6 on the left and 4.5 on the right, and the lung transparency gradients are 3.4 on the left and 3.3 on the right. These measurements are within normal limits. The image also shows no abnormalities in the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
