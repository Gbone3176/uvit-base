The chest X-ray appears to have normal findings, with no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. Additionally, the clavicle-spine distance ratio is 1.0, and the lung transparency gradients are as follows: right lung 0.75, left lung 0.75, and bilateral lung 0.75. These measurements are within the normal range. The image is considered metric-verified normal, and there are no artifacts present.
