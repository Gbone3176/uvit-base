The chest X-ray shows good symmetry and alignment of the bone structure. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 0.85, and the lung transparency gradients are 2.5 for the left lung and 2.4 for the right lung. These measurements are within the normal range, indicating that the lung transparency and overall appearance of the chest X-ray are consistent with what is expected for a healthy individual.
