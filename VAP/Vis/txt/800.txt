The chest X-ray shows symmetrical chest structures and proper alignment of the clavicle and spine. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are observed in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients are consistent with normal findings. The image is of metric-verified normal observations, with no artifacts noted.
