The chest X-ray appears to be normal, with no significant findings. The chest symmetry and bone structure alignment are in order, and there are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits. The structure findings are consistent with the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
