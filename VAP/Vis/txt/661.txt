This chest X-ray shows good symmetry and alignment of the chest bones. There are no visible signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients appear to be within normal limits. The image is free of artifacts, and the structures are clearly visible.
