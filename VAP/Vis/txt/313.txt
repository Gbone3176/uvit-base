The chest X-ray appears to have normal findings, with no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratio and lung transparency gradients are also within normal limits. In terms of RSNA standards, the image shows good alignment of the chest structures, and there are no artifacts present.
