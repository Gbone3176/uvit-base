The chest X-ray shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 2.0 and 1.8, and the lung transparency gradients are 16.5 and 15.5. These findings are consistent with normal observations, as per the RSNA standards for reporting chest X-rays.
