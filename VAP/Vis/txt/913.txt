In this chest X-ray, the symmetry and alignment of the chest structures appear to be normal. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures were observed in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients were also found to be within normal limits. The structure findings were made according to the standards of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA). As a visual assistant, it is important to remember not to provide any conclusions or recommendations based on the image alone.
