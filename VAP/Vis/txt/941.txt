The chest X-ray appears to have normal chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 1.0, and lung transparency gradients are 2.0. These findings are consistent with normal anatomy and are considered metric-verified normal observations.
