The chest X-ray appears to have normal symmetry and alignment of the chest bones. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are present in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits. The structure findings are consistent with RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
