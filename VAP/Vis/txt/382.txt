The chest X-ray demonstrates normal chest symmetry, with the clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients within normal limits. The image shows no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The visual measurements include a clavicle-spine distance ratio of 0.61 and lung transparency gradients of 1.03, 1.02, and 1.00. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for chest X-ray imaging, with technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
