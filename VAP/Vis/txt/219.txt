In the chest X-ray, the symmetry of the chest and the alignment of the bone structure appear to be normal. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.66, and the lung transparency gradients are 1.43. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes. It is important to note that no conclusions or recommendations should be drawn from this image.
