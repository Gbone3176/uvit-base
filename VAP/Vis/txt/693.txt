The chest X-ray shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 1.0, and the lung transparency gradients indicate normal observations. The RSNA standard for this image is 20%, which refers to the technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
