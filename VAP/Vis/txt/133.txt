The chest X-ray appears to be symmetrical, with the clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients within normal limits. This means that the bones and structures in the image are well-aligned and there are no visible signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The image is consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
