The chest X-ray appears to be normal, with no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits. The image shows good alignment of the chest structures, and the visual measurements are consistent with the RSNA standards for normal observations. Artifact notes are also provided.
