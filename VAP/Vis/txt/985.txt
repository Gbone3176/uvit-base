The chest X-ray image shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are present. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are normal, with a clavicle-spine distance of 0.53 and a clavicle-spine distance ratio of 0.58. The lung transparency gradients are also normal, with a ratio of 0.67. The image is free of artifacts, and the findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
