In this chest X-ray, the clavicle-spine distance ratios (CSD) are observed as 1.5, and the lung transparency gradients (LTG) are observed as 1.0. These measurements are based on the patient's body habitus and are in agreement with the metric-verified normal observations. No abnormalities or artifacts were observed in the image.
