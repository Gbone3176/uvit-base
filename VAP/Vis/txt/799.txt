The chest X-ray in this case shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients are also within normal ranges. The findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for a normal chest X-ray, with no significant abnormalities detected.
