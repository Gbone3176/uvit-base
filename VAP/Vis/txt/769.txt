The chest X-ray appears to be symmetric, with well-aligned bone structures. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits. The structure findings are in accordance with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
