The chest X-ray appears to be normal, with no visible abnormalities. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within the expected range. The image shows good alignment of the chest structures, and there are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The visual measurements and anatomic survey are consistent with the RSNA standards, and the image is metric-verified normal. Artifact notes are also provided.
