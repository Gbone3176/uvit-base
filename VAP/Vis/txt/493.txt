The chest X-ray appears to be symmetrical, with good alignment of the clavicle and spine. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are observed in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within normal limits. The findings in this chest X-ray are consistent with the RSNA standards for radiology reports, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
