This chest X-ray appears to be symmetric and shows proper alignment of the clavicle and spine. There is no evidence of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients are also normal. The visual measurements of the clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
