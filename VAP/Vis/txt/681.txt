The chest X-ray appears to have normal symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 0.75, and the lung transparency gradients are 1.5. These findings are consistent with normal anatomy and do not show any abnormalities or pathological changes.
