This chest X-ray demonstrates normal chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no visible signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is measured at 0.83, which is within the normal range. The lung transparency gradients are also normal, indicating clear lung fields. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for a normal chest X-ray.
