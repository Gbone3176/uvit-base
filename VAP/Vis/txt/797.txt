The chest X-ray shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 1.1 and 1.0, and the lung transparency gradients are 2.5 and 2.0. These findings are in accordance with RSNA standards, which involve a technical factors survey, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
