This chest X-ray shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients are normal. The image is consistent with RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes. Keep in mind that no conclusions or recommendations should be drawn from this observation.
