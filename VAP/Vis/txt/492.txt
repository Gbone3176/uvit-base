The chest X-ray appears to be symmetric, with good alignment of the chest wall bones, including the clavicles and spine. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 1.0, and the lung transparency gradients are 1.0. These findings are consistent with RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes. However, it is important to note that no conclusions or recommendations should be drawn from this image alone.
