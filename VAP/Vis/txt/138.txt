In this chest X-ray image, the clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients appear to be normal. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 0.5, and the lung transparency gradients are 1. The image is taken at a 45-degree angle, and no artifacts are detected. The chest appears to be symmetric, and there are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures.
