In this chest X-ray, the symmetry of the chest and the alignment of the bone structures are observed. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are detected. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are measured, which help assess the overall lung condition and any potential abnormalities. The structure findings are reported according to the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes. It is important to note that no conclusions or recommendations should be provided based on the information presented in the chest X-ray.
