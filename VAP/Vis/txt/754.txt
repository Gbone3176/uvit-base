The chest X-ray shows normal chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients appear to be within normal limits. The structure findings are based on RSNA standards, with technical factors considered first, followed by anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
