The chest X-ray shows good chest symmetry and alignment of bone structures, with no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.79, with a left-right ratio of 0.95. The lung transparency gradients are 2.06, with a left-right ratio of 0.95. These findings are in agreement with the RSNA standards for chest X-rays.
