The chest X-ray appears to have normal symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.45 and 0.42, and the lung transparency gradients are 1.5 and 1.6. These findings are in accordance with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
