In this chest X-ray, the overall chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal, excluding signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within normal limits. The image is taken according to RSNA standards, focusing on technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
