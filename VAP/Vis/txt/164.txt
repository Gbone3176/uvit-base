The chest X-ray appears to be normal, showing symmetrical chest wall and bone structure alignment. There are no visible signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients indicate normal lung tissue. The image is free of artifacts, and the structures are clearly visible.
