This chest X-ray appears to be symmetric, with no visible signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within normal limits. The image is clear and free of artifacts. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
