The chest X-ray appears to have normal symmetry and alignment of the chest bones. There are no visible signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within normal limits. The structure findings are consistent with RSNA standards, with the exception of some artifacts that may affect the clarity of the image.
