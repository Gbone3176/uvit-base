The chest X-ray appears to have normal symmetry and bone structure alignment, with no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also normal. All anatomical structures are metric-verified, and there are no artifacts present in the image.
