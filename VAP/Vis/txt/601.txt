The chest X-ray appears to be normal, showing good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within the expected range for a healthy individual. The findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for a normal chest X-ray.
