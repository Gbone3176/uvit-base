In this chest X-ray, the patient's chest appears to be symmetric, and the bone structure alignment is also observed. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits. The lung transparency gradients are 1.0 for the right lung and 1.0 for the left lung. The image is free of artifacts.
