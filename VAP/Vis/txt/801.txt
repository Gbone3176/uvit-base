The chest X-ray image shows chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures were detected in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients appear to be normal. The image was taken using standard radiographic techniques and follows the reporting standards of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA).
