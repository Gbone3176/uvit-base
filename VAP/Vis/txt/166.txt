The chest X-ray shows good chest symmetry and alignment of the bone structure. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients appear to be within normal limits. The structure findings are consistent with RSNA standards, and no artifacts are noted.
