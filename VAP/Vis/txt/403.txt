In this chest X-ray, the chest symmetry appears to be normal, with no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within the normal range. The lung transparency gradients are also observed to be normal. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
