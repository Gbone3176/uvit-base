In this chest X-ray, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are observed in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits. The image is consistent with metric-verified normal observations according to the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) standards. There are no artifacts noted in the image.
