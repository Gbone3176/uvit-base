In this chest X-ray, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal, excluding signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are all within the normal range, with the right and left side measurements being 0.99 and 0.93, respectively. The lung transparency gradients are also within the normal range, with a right side measurement of 0.57 and a left side measurement of 0.54. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
