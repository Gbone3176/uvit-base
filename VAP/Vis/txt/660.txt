In this chest X-ray image, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal, with no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within normal limits. The image is in agreement with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
