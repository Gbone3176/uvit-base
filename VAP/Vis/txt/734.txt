The chest X-ray shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.82, 0.82, and 0.81, and the lung transparency gradients are 2.5, 2.5, and 2.5. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
