Chest X-ray: No Finding

Chest symmetry and bone structure alignment are present in the image. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are observed. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is measured to be 0.67, and the lung transparency gradients are found to be 1.92. These measurements are in accordance with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
