The chest X-ray appears to be normal, as no findings were observed. The chest symmetry and bone structure alignment were found to be appropriate, excluding signs of pneumothorax, effusion, mass, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients were also within normal limits. The findings were structured according to the RSNA standards, with technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
