In this chest X-ray, the symmetry of the chest and the alignment of the bone structure are within normal limits. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal ranges, and the lung transparency gradients are also normal. The findings in this image are consistent with the RSNA standards for a normal chest X-ray.
