The chest X-ray appears to be normal, with no findings of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within the expected range. The image shows proper alignment of the chest structures, and there are no technical factors, anatomic survey findings, or metric-verified normal observations. Additionally, there are no artifact notes present in the image.
