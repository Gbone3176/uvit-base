The chest X-ray shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are present in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are measured as 0.11 and 0.12, and the lung transparency gradients are measured as 1.36 and 1.40. The findings are consistent with RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes. However, it is important to note that no conclusions or recommendations are provided in this report.
