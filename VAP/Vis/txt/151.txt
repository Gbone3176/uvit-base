The chest X-ray image shows normal chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures detected in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients appear to be normal. The findings in this chest X-ray are consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
