In this chest X-ray, the image shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are present. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.62-0.68, and the lung transparency gradients are 4-5. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
