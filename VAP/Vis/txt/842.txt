The chest X-ray image shows chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 0.68, and the lung transparency gradient is 0.52. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for evaluating chest X-rays.
