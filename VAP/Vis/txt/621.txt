The chest X-ray in this image appears to show normal chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients are also normal. The image is described according to the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
