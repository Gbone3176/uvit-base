The chest X-ray appears to be symmetric, with bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.55 and 0.58, and the lung transparency gradients are 1.00 and 1.05. These findings are consistent with the radiology report style, which focuses on precise measurements and observations of the anatomy without drawing any conclusions or recommendations.
