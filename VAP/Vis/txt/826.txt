The chest X-ray appears to be symmetrical, with good alignment of the clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are visible in the image. The RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes are all present.
