The chest X-ray appears to be symmetric and shows aligned bone structure. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are evident in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits. The structure findings conform to the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
