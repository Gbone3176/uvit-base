In this chest X-ray, the symmetry of the chest and the alignment of the bone structures appear to be normal. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures detected in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within normal limits. The findings in the image are considered metric-verified normal observations, and there are no artifact notes.
