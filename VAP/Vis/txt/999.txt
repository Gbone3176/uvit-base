This chest X-ray shows normal chest symmetry, with the clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients indicating no significant abnormalities. The image is free of signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The visual measurements and observations are consistent with the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
