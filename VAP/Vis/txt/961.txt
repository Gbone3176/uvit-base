In this chest X-ray, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal. The image does not show any signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. Additionally, the clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits. This is a metric-verified normal observation, as per the RSNA standards.
