In the chest X-ray, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are observed. The clavicle-spine distance ratios (CDRs) and lung transparency gradients (LTGs) are within normal limits. The image is visually clear, and the structures are well-defined according to the RSNA standards.
