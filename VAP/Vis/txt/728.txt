In this chest X-ray, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be within normal limits. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are mentioned as 2.2, which is a normal observation. The lung transparency gradients are also mentioned, but no specific details are provided. The structure findings are reported according to the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
