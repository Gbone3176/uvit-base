The chest X-ray shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures were found in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients appear to be within normal limits. The findings in this chest X-ray are consistent with the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes. It is important to remember that the purpose of this report is to provide a detailed visual assessment of the chest X-ray, but not to draw any conclusions or recommendations.
