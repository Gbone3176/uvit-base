In this chest X-ray, the patient's chest appears to be symmetric, with normal bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures present in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients are also normal. According to the RSNA standards, the image shows metric-verified normal observations, with no artifacts detected.
