This chest X-ray demonstrates chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits. Structure findings are in accordance with RSNA standards, with technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
