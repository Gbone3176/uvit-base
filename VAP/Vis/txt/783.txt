The chest X-ray appears to be symmetrical, with the clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients being within the normal range. The image does not exhibit signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The visual measurements and findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for chest radiography, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
