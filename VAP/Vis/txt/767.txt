This chest X-ray appears to be symmetrical, with normal alignment of the clavicle and spine. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits. The image is consistent with the RSNA standards, with technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
