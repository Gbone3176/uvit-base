This chest X-ray image shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients appear to be within normal limits. The image is of high quality and meets the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
