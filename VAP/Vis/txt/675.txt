The chest X-ray appears to be symmetric, with normal alignment of the chest wall bones. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits, as defined by the RSNA standards. The image is free of any artifacts that could interfere with the interpretation of the findings.
