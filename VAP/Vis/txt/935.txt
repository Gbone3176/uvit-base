The chest X-ray shows normal chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients appear normal. The image is consistent with the RSNA standards for radiology reporting, with technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
