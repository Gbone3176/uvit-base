In this chest X-ray, the overall chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal. There are no visible signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within normal limits. The image is consistent with the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
