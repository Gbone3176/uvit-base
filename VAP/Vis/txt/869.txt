This chest X-ray demonstrates normal symmetry and alignment of the chest bones. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are present in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.77, and the lung transparency gradients range from 0.96 to 0.93. These findings are consistent with normal anatomy and are metric-verified as per RSNA standards.
