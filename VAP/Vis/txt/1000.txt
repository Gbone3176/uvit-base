In this chest X-ray image, the chest appears to be symmetric, and the bone structure alignment is also normal. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 0.7, and the lung transparency gradients are 3/5. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
