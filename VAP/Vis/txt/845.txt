In the chest X-ray, the overall chest symmetry appears to be normal, with good alignment of the clavicle and spine. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are evident in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits, as per RSNA standards. The image shows normal anatomic structures, and there are no artifacts present.
