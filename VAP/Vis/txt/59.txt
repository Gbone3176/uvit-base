This chest X-ray shows normal chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients indicate that the lungs appear clear and free of any significant abnormalities. The findings are in accordance with RSNA standards for normal observations, with no technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
