The chest X-ray shows symmetrical chest bones with alignment of the clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures were observed in the image. Additionally, the image demonstrates metric-verified normal observations, which are in agreement with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
