This chest X-ray demonstrates normal symmetry and alignment of the chest structures, with no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within the normal range, indicating that the structures are well-aligned and the lungs appear transparent. The findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for a radiology report, which emphasize technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
