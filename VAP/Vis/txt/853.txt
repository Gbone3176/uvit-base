In this chest X-ray, the image shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.78 and 0.89, and the lung transparency gradients are 1.00 and 1.00. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
