In this chest X-ray, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal. There are no visible signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within the normal range, and the lung transparency gradients are also within the expected range. The RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes are all met in this image.
