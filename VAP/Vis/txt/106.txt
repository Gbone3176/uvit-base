The chest X-ray appears to be symmetric, with the clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients within normal limits. The image does not show any signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The visual measurements of the clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.81, and the lung transparency gradients are 1.25. These findings are in accordance with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
