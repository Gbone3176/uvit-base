In this chest X-ray image, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are present. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within the normal range, and the lung transparency gradients show an absence of abnormal findings. The image is metric-verified, and no artifacts were noted.
