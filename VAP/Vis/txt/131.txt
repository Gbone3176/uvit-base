This chest X-ray image shows good symmetry and alignment of the chest bones. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients appear to be normal. The image is structured according to RSNA standards, with technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
