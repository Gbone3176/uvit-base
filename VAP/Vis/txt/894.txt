In this chest X-ray, we observe a normal chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no visible signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients appear to be within normal limits. The anatomic survey of the chest X-ray shows no abnormalities, and the metric-verified normal observations are in agreement with the RSNA standards. No artifacts were noted in this image.
