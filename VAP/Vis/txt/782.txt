The chest X-ray image shows normal chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures present in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients are consistent with healthy lung tissue. This chest X-ray meets the RSNA standards for normal observations, with technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
