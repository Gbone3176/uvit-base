In the chest X-ray, the image appears to be symmetric, with the clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients in agreement with the RSNA standards. There is no evidence of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. The visual measurements of clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits. The structure findings are consistent with the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
