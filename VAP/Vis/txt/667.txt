The chest X-ray image shows normal bilateral lung fields, with no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients appear to be within normal limits. The image is consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
