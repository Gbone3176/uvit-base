This chest X-ray shows normal symmetry and alignment of the chest wall, excluding any signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients appear to be within normal limits, as per RSNA standards. The image is free of any significant artifacts that could interfere with the assessment of the chest structures.
