In this chest X-ray, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within expected ranges. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. The findings are in accordance with the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
