In this chest X-ray, the overall chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are observed. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits, as measured in the image. The structure findings are based on the RSNA standards for reporting diagnostic images.
