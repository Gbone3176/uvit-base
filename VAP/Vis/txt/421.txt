The chest X-ray appears to be symmetric and shows normal alignment of the chest bones. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures present in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients are also normal. The image is free of artifacts, and the findings are consistent with a normal chest X-ray according to the RSNA standards.
