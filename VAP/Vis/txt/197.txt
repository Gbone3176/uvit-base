In the chest X-ray image, the overall appearance of the chest is symmetric, and the bone structure alignment is also symmetric. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 0.53, and the lung transparency gradients are 5/5. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for radiology reports, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
