The chest X-ray appears to be symmetric, with well-aligned bone structures. There are no visible signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients are also within normal ranges. The image is free of artifacts, and the visual measurements are consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
