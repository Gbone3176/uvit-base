The chest X-ray appears to be normal, showing chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients are also normal. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for chest X-ray reporting.
