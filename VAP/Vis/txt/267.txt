The chest X-ray appears to be normal, as there are no findings such as pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios (CSD) and lung transparency gradients (LTG) are within the normal range. The image is metric-verified, and the technical factors, anatomic survey, and metric-verified normal observations are all in agreement. Artifact notes are also provided, as per the RSNA standards.
