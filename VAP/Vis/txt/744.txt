This chest X-ray image shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. The signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, and fractures are explicitly excluded. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients appear to be within normal limits. The image is in accordance with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes. It is important to remember that no conclusions or recommendations should be drawn from this image alone.
