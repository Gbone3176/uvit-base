In this chest X-ray, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.79, and the lung transparency gradients are 4+. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for reporting chest X-rays.
