In the chest X-ray, the clavicle-spine distance ratio is 0.5, and the lung transparency gradients are 0.8. These measurements are in good agreement with the RSNA standards. The chest X-ray does not show any signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The image is described as having good symmetry and bone structure alignment.
