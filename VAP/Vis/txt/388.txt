The chest X-ray shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures evident in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients appear to be normal. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for a normal chest X-ray.
