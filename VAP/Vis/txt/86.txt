The chest X-ray shows overall chest symmetry and proper bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients appear to be normal. The findings are consistent with the RSNA standards, including technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
