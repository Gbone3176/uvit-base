In this chest X-ray image, the chest appears to be symmetric, with good alignment of the bone structures. The image does not show any signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within normal limits. The findings in the image are consistent with the RSNA standards for radiology reports.
