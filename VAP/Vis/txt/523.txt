This chest X-ray is characterized by normal chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. It is important to note that there are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. Additionally, the clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients appear to be within normal limits. These findings conform to the RSNA standards for chest X-ray reporting, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
