In this chest X-ray, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients show no abnormalities. The image is described according to the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
