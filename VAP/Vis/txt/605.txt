In the chest X-ray, I observe overall chest symmetry and bone structure alignment, which means that the structures within the chest cavity appear to be in their normal positions and proportions. I explicitly exclude signs of pneumothorax (collapsed lung), effusion (fluid accumulation), masses (abnormal growths), and fractures.

The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.66, and the lung transparency gradients are 4+, which indicates normal lung transparency. These findings are based on the RSNA standards for reporting diagnostic imaging, following the technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
