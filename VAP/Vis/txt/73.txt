In the chest X-ray image, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal, with no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within the normal range according to RSNA standards. The structure findings are consistent with normal anatomy, and no artifacts were identified in the image.
