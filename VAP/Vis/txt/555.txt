In this chest X-ray, the clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.47 and 0.51, and the lung transparency gradients are 3 and 4. These measurements help assess the alignment and symmetry of the chest structures, as well as the lung transparency, which can provide valuable information about the patient's overall health and any potential abnormalities.
