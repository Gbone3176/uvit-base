In the chest X-ray image, the clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.47 and 0.46. These ratios indicate a normal anatomic alignment. The lung transparency gradients, which are a measure of the opacity or density of the lung tissue, are 2 and 2. These gradients also suggest normal lung tissue. The image does not show any signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures.
