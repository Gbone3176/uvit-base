The chest X-ray appears to be normal, as there are no findings of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits. The image is in agreement with RSNA standards, which means that the technical factors, anatomic survey, and metric-verified normal observations are all within acceptable ranges. Additionally, there are no artifacts noted in the image.
