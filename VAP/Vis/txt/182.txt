The chest X-ray image is described as having normal symmetry and alignment of the chest bones, with no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within the normal range, and the lung transparency gradients show normal lung tissue. The findings are reported according to the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes. It is important to remember not to provide any conclusions or recommendations based on this image.
