The chest X-ray shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 2.6, and the lung transparency gradients are 3.8. These findings are consistent with normal observations according to RSNA standards. Artifact notes are not applicable in this case.
