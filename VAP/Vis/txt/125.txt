The chest X-ray appears to have normal symmetry and alignment of the chest wall, including the clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients. There are no visible signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. The visual measurements of the clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within the normal range. The structure findings are in accordance with the RSNA standards, with no technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, or artifact notes.
