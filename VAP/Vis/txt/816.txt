The chest X-ray appears to show normal findings. The chest symmetry and bone structure alignment are within normal limits, and no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are observed. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within normal ranges. The findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for chest X-rays, which involve technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
