The chest X-ray image shows good symmetry and alignment of the chest bones. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and lung transparency gradients are normal. The structure findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for chest X-rays.
