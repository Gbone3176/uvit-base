In this chest X-ray, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within normal limits. The anatomic survey is unremarkable, with no metric-verified abnormalities observed. Artifact notes are also unremarkable.
