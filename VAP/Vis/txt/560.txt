In this chest X-ray, there is no evidence of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients appear to be normal. The visual measurements are consistent with the RSNA standards for chest X-rays, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
