The chest X-ray appears to have normal findings. The chest symmetry and bone structure alignment are within normal limits, with no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within normal ranges. The only artifact noted in the image is a small metallic object, which is not significant enough to affect the interpretation of the chest X-ray.
