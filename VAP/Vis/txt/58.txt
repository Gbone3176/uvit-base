The chest X-ray appears to be symmetric, with good alignment of the clavicle and spine. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 1.0, and the lung transparency gradients are 4.0. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes. It is important to remember that no conclusions or recommendations should be drawn from the image alone.
