The chest X-ray appears to be symmetric, with proper alignment of the clavicle and spine. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are evident in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 1.0, and the lung transparency gradients are 3.5. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for reporting chest X-rays.
