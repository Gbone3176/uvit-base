The chest X-ray does not show any signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 90%, and the lung transparency gradients indicate that the patient's lungs are within normal limits. The image is of excellent quality, which allows for clear visualization of the structures. The radiology report is structured according to the RSNA (Radiological Society of North America) standards, with technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
