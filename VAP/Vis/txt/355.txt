In this chest X-ray, the chest appears to be symmetric, and the bone structure alignment is also observed. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are detected in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits, as per RSNA standards. The image is metric-verified normal, with no artifacts noted.
