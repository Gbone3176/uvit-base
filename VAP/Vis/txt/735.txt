The chest X-ray appears to be symmetric, with well-aligned bone structures. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures were detected in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients were found to be within normal limits. The findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for a normal chest X-ray, with technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
