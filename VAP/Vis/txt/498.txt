The chest X-ray shows good alignment of the ribs and clavicle-spine distance ratios. There is no evidence of pneumothorax, pleural effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. The lung transparency gradients appear to be normal, with no significant abnormalities detected. The image is in agreement with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
