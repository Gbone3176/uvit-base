In the chest X-ray image, the overall chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within the normal range, and the lung transparency gradients are consistent with healthy lung tissue. The chest X-ray findings are in agreement with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
