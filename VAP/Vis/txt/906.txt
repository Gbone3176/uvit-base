In this chest X-ray, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures were observed in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 0.6, and the lung transparency gradients are 1.5. These findings are consistent with normal anatomy and structure, as defined by the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) standards.
