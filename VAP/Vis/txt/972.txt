The chest X-ray appears to show normal findings, with chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients are also normal. The image was taken with a 140 kV tube voltage and a 250 mA tube current, using a 0.5 mm focal spot and a 2-mm-thick aluminum filter.
