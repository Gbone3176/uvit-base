The chest X-ray shows good symmetry and alignment of the chest wall bones. There are no visible signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.64, and the lung transparency gradients are 4.0. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
