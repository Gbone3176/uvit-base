In this chest X-ray, the chest symmetry appears to be normal, and the bone structure alignment is also within the expected range. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are observed in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.97, and the lung transparency gradients are 4, which are both within the normal range. The findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
