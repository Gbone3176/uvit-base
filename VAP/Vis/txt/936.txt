This chest X-ray demonstrates normal chest symmetry and alignment of bone structures, without any signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients are also within normal limits. The overall structure findings are consistent with RSNA standards, which emphasize technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
