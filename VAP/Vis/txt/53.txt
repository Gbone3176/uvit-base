The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within the expected range, with a clavicle-spine distance ratio of 1.3. The lung transparency gradients are also within the normal range, with a left lung transparency gradient of 0.8 and a right lung transparency gradient of 0.9.

According to the RSNA standards, the technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes are all within normal limits. It is important to remember that this chest X-ray is considered to have no findings, and no conclusions or recommendations should be drawn from the image.
