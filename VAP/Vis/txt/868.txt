In this chest X-ray image, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal, without any signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.85, and the lung transparency gradients are 0.95. These measurements are within the expected range for healthy individuals. The structures are found to be normal according to the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
