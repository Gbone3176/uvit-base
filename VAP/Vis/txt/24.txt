In this chest X-ray, the overall symmetry and alignment of the chest bones appear to be normal. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are present in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within normal limits, as they are metric-verified normal observations. Artifact notes are provided to ensure the image quality is maintained.
