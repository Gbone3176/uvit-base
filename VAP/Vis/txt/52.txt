The chest X-ray image shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment, with no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.65, and the lung transparency gradients are 2.5. These findings are consistent with normal chest X-ray imaging, according to the RSNA standards for radiology reports.
