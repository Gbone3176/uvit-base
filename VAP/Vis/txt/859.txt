The chest X-ray shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.57, and the lung transparency gradients are 0.63. These measurements are within normal ranges for the patient. The findings are consistent with the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes. It is important to remember that no conclusions or recommendations should be drawn from this chest X-ray.
