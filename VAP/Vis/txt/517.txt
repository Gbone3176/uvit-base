The chest X-ray shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures detected in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and lung transparency gradients appear normal. The image is metric-verified and conforms to RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
