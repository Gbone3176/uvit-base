The chest X-ray appears to be symmetrical, with normal alignment of the clavicle and spine. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients are consistent with normal lung tissue. The image is free from any significant artifacts.
