This chest X-ray shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. The image does not exhibit any signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.53, and the lung transparency gradients are 2.5. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
