This chest X-ray shows chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. The image does not reveal any signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 0.76, and the lung transparency gradients are 2.5 (right) and 2.3 (left). These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes. It is important to note that no conclusions or recommendations should be drawn from this chest X-ray.
