This chest X-ray shows normal chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are normal, and the lung transparency gradients are within the expected range. The findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for chest X-rays, with technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
