The chest X-ray image shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 0.35, and the lung transparency gradients are 2.5. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for a normal chest X-ray, with no artifacts noted.
