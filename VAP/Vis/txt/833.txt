The chest X-ray appears to be symmetric in terms of chest wall alignment, with no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 0.70, and the lung transparency gradients are normal. The findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
