The chest X-ray shows good alignment of the chest symmetry and bone structure. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 0.75, and the lung transparency gradients are 4.5. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
