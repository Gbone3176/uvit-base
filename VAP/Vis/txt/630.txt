The chest X-ray appears to be symmetric, with aligned bone structures. There are no visible signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 0.46, and the lung transparency gradients are 0.88, 0.92, 0.95, and 0.99. These measurements and observations are consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
