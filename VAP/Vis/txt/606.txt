This chest X-ray shows good symmetry and alignment of the chest wall bones. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 0.50, and the lung transparency gradients are 1.00, 1.00, and 1.00 for the left, middle, and right lung fields, respectively. Structural findings are consistent with RSNA standards.
