In this chest X-ray image, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are observed. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.83, and the lung transparency gradients are 1.0. These findings are consistent with normal anatomy and are metric-verified. Artifact notes include the presence of a central venous catheter and a chest tube.
