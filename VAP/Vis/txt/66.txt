The chest X-ray shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients appear to be within normal limits. The image is consistent with the RSNA standards for radiology reporting, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
