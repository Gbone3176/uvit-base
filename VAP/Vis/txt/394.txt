The chest X-ray appears to show normal chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients are also normal. The image is free of any significant artifacts that could affect the interpretation of the findings.
