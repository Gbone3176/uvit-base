In this chest X-ray, the focus is on the normal anatomy and alignment of the chest structures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are observed to be within normal limits. The chest X-ray shows no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The image is aligned according to RSNA standards, with technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
