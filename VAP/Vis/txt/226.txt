The chest X-ray appears to be symmetrical, with no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 1.0, and the lung transparency gradients are 2.5, 2.5, 2.5, and 2.5. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
