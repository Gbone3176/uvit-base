The chest X-ray shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are present in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 0.50, and the lung transparency gradients are 1.00. These findings are consistent with normal anatomy and are considered metric-verified normal observations according to RSNA standards.
