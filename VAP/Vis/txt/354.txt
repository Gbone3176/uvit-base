The chest X-ray appears to be symmetric in shape and alignment of the bone structures. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits. The image is consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
