The chest X-ray appears to be symmetrical, with good alignment of the clavicle and spine. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are present in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients are also normal. The image is of metric-verified normal quality, with no artifacts.
