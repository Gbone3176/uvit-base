In this chest X-ray, the clavicle-spine distance ratios are observed to be 1.00 and 1.00, respectively. These measurements indicate that the alignment of the clavicles and spine appears normal. Additionally, the lung transparency gradients are observed to be 2.00 and 2.00, respectively, which also suggests normal lung transparency.
