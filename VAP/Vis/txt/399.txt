The chest X-ray image shows normal chest symmetry and alignment of the bone structure. There is no evidence of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. Additionally, the clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits. The image is structured according to the Reporting and Data System (RSNA) standards for chest X-rays, with a focus on technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
