The chest X-ray appears to be normal, with no significant findings. The image shows good symmetry and alignment of the chest wall, including the clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. The RSNA standards for radiology reporting are followed, with technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
