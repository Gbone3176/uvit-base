The chest X-ray demonstrates chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. No signs of pneumothorax/effusion/masses/fractures are observed. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 0.87, and the lung transparency gradients are 2/3 (left) and 3/3 (right). These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for a normal chest X-ray. Artifact notes should be provided if any artifacts are present in the image.
