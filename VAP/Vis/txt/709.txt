The chest X-ray appears to be normal, as there are no findings of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within normal limits. The image is aligned with RSNA standards, and the visual measurements are metric-verified normal observations. Artifact notes are provided where necessary.
