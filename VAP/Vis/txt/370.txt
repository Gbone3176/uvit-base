In this chest X-ray, the chest symmetry appears to be normal, with the bone structures aligned. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures were observed in the image. Additionally, the clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients were found to be within normal limits. The findings were reported according to the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes. It is important to note that no conclusions or recommendations were provided in this context.
