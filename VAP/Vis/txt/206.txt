In this chest X-ray, the image shows good chest symmetry and alignment of the bone structure. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios, which are the distances between the clavicle and the spine in relation to the total height of the chest, appear to be within normal limits. The lung transparency gradients, which are a measure of how transparent the lungs are on the X-ray, are also within normal limits. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for a normal chest X-ray.
