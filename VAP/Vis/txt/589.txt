The chest X-ray shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are evident in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios appear to be within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients are consistent with the patient's age and gender. The image is metric-verified normal, with no artifacts detected.
