The chest X-ray appears to be symmetric, with proper alignment of the clavicle and spine. There are no visible signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. Additionally, the clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits. The findings in this chest X-ray are consistent with the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes. It is important to note that no conclusions or recommendations should be drawn from this image.
