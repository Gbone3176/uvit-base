In this chest X-ray image, the clavicle-spine distance ratio is 0.93, and the lung transparency gradients are as follows: left lung 4.5, right lung 4.3. These measurements are based on the RSNA standards for radiological reporting. The image shows no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The lung transparency gradients are considered normal, indicating that the lungs appear to be well-aerated and free of any significant abnormalities.
