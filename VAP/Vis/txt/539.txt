The chest X-ray appears to have normal symmetry and alignment of the chest wall bones. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures were observed in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients were also found to be within normal limits. The findings were reported according to RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
