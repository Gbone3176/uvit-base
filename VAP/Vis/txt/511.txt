The chest X-ray appears to have normal symmetry and alignment of the chest wall bones, with no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within normal limits. The anatomic survey of the chest X-ray shows normal structure findings, as per the RSNA standards.
