The chest X-ray image shows normal chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.40 and 0.42, and the lung transparency gradients are 0.88 and 0.84. These findings are consistent with the normal anatomy and structure of the chest, as per the RSNA standards.
