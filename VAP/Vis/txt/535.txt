The chest X-ray appears to be symmetric in both the clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures were observed in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 0.48, and the lung transparency gradients are 3.4 on the right side and 3.8 on the left side. The image is in compliance with RSNA standards, with technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
