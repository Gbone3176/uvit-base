The chest X-ray demonstrates chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are present in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.26, 0.28, and 0.33, while the lung transparency gradients are 2.25 and 2.17. These findings are metric-verified normal observations, and no artifacts were noted.
