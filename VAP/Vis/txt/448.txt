The chest X-ray image shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.29 for the right side and 0.28 for the left side, with a standard deviation of 0.01. The lung transparency gradients are 0.45 for the right side and 0.47 for the left side, with a standard deviation of 0.02. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
