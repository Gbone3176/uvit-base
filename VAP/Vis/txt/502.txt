The chest X-ray shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no visible signs of pneumothorax/effusion/masses/fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 0.71, and the lung transparency gradients are as follows: 1.50 for the right lung and 1.54 for the left lung. These findings are in accordance with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
