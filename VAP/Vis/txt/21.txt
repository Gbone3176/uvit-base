The chest X-ray appears to have good symmetry and bone structure alignment, with no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.73 and 0.81, and the lung transparency gradients are 4.6 and 4.8. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes. It is important to note that no conclusions or recommendations should be drawn from this information.
