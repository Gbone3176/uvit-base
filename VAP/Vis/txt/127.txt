In this chest X-ray image, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal, with no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits, as per the RSNA standards. The visual measurements and observations are metric-verified and artifact-free.
