The image shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the chest X-ray. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 0.6, and the lung transparency gradients are mostly normal, with a few areas showing mild to moderate haziness. These findings are in accordance with the RSNA standards for radiology reports, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
