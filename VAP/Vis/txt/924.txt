The chest X-ray image shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are present. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 0.27, and the lung transparency gradients are reported to be within the normal range. The findings are in agreement with RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
