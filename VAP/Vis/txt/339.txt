The chest X-ray shows normal chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are observed in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients are also within normal ranges. The image is consistent with RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
