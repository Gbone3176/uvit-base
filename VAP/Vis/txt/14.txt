In this chest X-ray, the patient's chest appears to have good symmetry and proper alignment of the clavicle and spine. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 0.75, and the lung transparency grade is 4. These findings are consistent with RSNA standards for a normal chest X-ray.
