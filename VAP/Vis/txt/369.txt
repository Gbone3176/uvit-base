The chest X-ray appears to be normal, as there are no findings of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within normal limits. The image is well-aligned and free of artifacts. This suggests that the patient's chest structures are symmetrical and the bones are properly aligned. However, it is important to remember that I am an AI language model and not a medical professional. The actual interpretation of the X-ray should be done by a healthcare professional.
