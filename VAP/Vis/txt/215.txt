In this chest X-ray, the clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients appear to be normal. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 1.0, 1.0, and 1.0 on the left, right, and middle, respectively. The lung transparency gradients are 1.0, 1.0, and 1.0 on the left, right, and middle, respectively. These measurements indicate that the patient's chest anatomy and bone structure alignment are within normal limits, and there are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image.
