The chest X-ray appears to be normal, as there are no findings of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits. The image is symmetric, and the bone structures are aligned. However, it is important to remember that I am a visual assistant and not a medical professional. I cannot provide any conclusions or recommendations based on this image.
