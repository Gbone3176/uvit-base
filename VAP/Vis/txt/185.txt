In the chest X-ray image, the chest symmetry appears to be normal, and the bone structure alignment is within the expected range. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.10, which is within the normal range for adults. The lung transparency gradients show clear lung fields, indicating good lung aeration. These findings are consistent with metric-verified normal observations and do not show any significant abnormalities.
