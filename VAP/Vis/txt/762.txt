This chest X-ray demonstrates normal chest symmetry and alignment of the bone structure. There are no visible signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 0.9, and the lung transparency gradients are 2.0 for the left lung and 1.7 for the right lung. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for a normal chest X-ray. Artifact notes are not provided in this context.
