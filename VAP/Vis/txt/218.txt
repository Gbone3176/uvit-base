This chest X-ray shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 75%, and the lung transparency gradients are 45%. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for anatomic survey and metric-verified normal observations. However, it is important to remember that I cannot provide any conclusions or recommendations based on this image.
