The chest X-ray shows normal symmetry and alignment of chest structures, excluding signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratio is 1.03, and the lung transparency gradients are 2.75 for the left lung and 2.73 for the right lung. These findings are consistent with the standards set by the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA).
