The chest X-ray appears to be symmetric in terms of chest wall and bone structure alignment. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are evident in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits. The RSNA standards for reporting chest X-rays include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
