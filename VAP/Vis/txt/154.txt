This chest X-ray image shows normal chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients are consistent with healthy lung tissue. The findings in this image are in accordance with the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes. It is important to remember that no conclusions or recommendations should be drawn from this image alone.
