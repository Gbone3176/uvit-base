The chest X-ray appears to show normal findings. The chest symmetry and bone structure alignment are within normal limits, with no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within the expected range for a healthy individual. The structure findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for chest X-rays, including technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
