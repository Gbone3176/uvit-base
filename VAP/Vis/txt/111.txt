In this chest X-ray image, the overall chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal, excluding signs of pneumothorax/effusion/masses/fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within normal limits. The visual measurements and structure findings are in accordance with the RSNA standards. However, it is important to remember that I am a medical imaging visual assistant and not a medical professional. I cannot provide any conclusions or recommendations based on the image.
