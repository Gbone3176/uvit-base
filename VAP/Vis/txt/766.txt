In this chest X-ray, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures present in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within normal limits. The structures are in accordance with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes. Keep in mind that I am a visual assistant and not a medical professional, so I cannot provide any conclusions or recommendations based on the image.
