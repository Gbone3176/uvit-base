In the chest X-ray, the symmetry and alignment of the chest, including the clavicle and spine, appear to be normal. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are observed. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within normal limits. The image is well-aligned and free of artifacts.
