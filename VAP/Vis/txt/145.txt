The chest X-ray image shows normal chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.34, and the lung transparency gradients are 1.07. These findings are consistent with RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
