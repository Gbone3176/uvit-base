In this chest X-ray, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures detected in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients show no abnormalities. The image adheres to the RSNA standards for reporting, with technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes being explicitly mentioned.
