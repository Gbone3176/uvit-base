This chest X-ray appears to have normal chest symmetry and bone structure alignment, with no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are measured and reported, with no significant abnormalities detected. The lung transparency gradients are also analyzed, providing information about the lung tissue's density and clarity. The findings are reported according to the RSNA standards, focusing on technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
