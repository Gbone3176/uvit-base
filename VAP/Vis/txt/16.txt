The chest X-ray appears to have normal chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients are also within the expected range. The image follows the RSNA standards for reporting, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
