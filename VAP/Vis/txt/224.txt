The chest X-ray shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients appear to be normal. The findings in the image are described according to the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) standards, focusing on technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
