The chest X-ray appears to be symmetrical, with the clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients within normal limits. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are present in the image. The visual measurements of clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within normal limits, according to RSNA standards. Artifact notes are also provided, as required by the standards.
