In this chest X-ray image, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within normal limits. According to the RSNA standards, the image shows metric-verified normal observations, with no artifacts noted.
