This chest X-ray image demonstrates good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.81 and 0.80, and the lung transparency gradients are 4.56 and 4.64. These measurements and findings are consistent with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
