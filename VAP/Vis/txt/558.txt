The chest X-ray appears to have normal findings, with no visible signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are also within normal limits. The image is consistent with the RSNA standards for a normal chest X-ray, and no artifacts are present.
