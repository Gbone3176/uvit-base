In this chest X-ray, the chest appears to be symmetric, with good alignment of the bone structures. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients show normal findings. This chest X-ray is consistent with the RSNA standards for radiology reporting, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
