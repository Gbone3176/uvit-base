The chest X-ray appears to be symmetric, with proper alignment of the clavicle and spine. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are observed in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.90, 0.92, and 0.90, and the lung transparency gradients are 3, 3, and 3. These findings are consistent with normal anatomy and the RSNA standards for chest X-rays.
