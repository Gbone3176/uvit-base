The chest X-ray image shows good symmetry and alignment of the chest bones. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures present in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are measured at 1.0, and the lung transparency gradients are graded as 1.0. These findings are considered normal according to the RSNA standards for chest X-rays.
