The chest X-ray appears to be symmetric, and the bone structure alignment is also observed. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.72, and the lung transparency gradients are 0.75. These measurements are within the normal range. The image is in agreement with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
