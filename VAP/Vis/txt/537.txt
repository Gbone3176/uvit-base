In the chest X-ray image, the clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients appear to be within normal limits. The image does not show any signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The structures in the image are aligned, and the technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes have been addressed according to RSNA standards.
