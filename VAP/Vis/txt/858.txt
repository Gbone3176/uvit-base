The chest X-ray shows good symmetry and alignment of the bone structures. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients appear normal. The findings in the image are consistent with the RSNA standards, with no technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
