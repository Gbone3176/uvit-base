The chest X-ray appears to be within normal limits, as there are no findings of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The image shows good alignment of the clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients. This suggests that the chest structures are symmetric and the lung tissue appears normal. The visual measurements are consistent with the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
