In this chest X-ray, there is excellent symmetry and alignment of the clavicles and spine. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are present in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.52, and the lung transparency gradients are 0.77. These findings are consistent with the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
