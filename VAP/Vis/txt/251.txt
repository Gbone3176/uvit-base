In this chest X-ray, the overall symmetry of the chest appears to be good, and the bone structure alignment is normal. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are present. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients show no abnormalities. The image is in agreement with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
