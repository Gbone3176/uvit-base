The chest X-ray image shows good chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, pleural effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.70, 0.73, and 0.75, and the lung transparency gradients are 1, 1, and 1. These measurements are within the normal range, indicating that the patient's chest structure appears to be within the expected range.
