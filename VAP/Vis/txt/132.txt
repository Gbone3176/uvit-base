In this chest X-ray, we observe normal chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients appear normal. The image shows no significant abnormalities in the chest area, aligning with the RSNA standards for radiology reports.
