This chest X-ray appears to be normal, as there are no findings of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios and lung transparency gradients are within normal limits. The image is consistent with the RSNA standards for radiology reports, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
