In this chest X-ray, the chest symmetry and bone structure alignment appear to be normal. There are no signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within the normal range, and the lung transparency gradients show no significant abnormalities. The findings in this image are consistent with the RSNA standards for reporting chest X-rays, which emphasize technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
