The chest X-ray appears to be symmetrical and shows proper alignment of the bone structure. The image does not exhibit any signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients are consistent with the expected range for healthy lungs. The findings in this chest X-ray are in accordance with the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
