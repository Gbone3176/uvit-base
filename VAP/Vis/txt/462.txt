In the chest X-ray image, the clavicle-spine distance ratios are 1.00, and the lung transparency gradients are 1.00. The image shows chest symmetry and bone structure alignment, excluding signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. These findings are considered normal according to the RSNA standards, which include technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
