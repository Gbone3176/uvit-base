In this chest X-ray, the symmetry and alignment of the chest bones, including the clavicles and spine, appear to be normal. There are no visible signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients show adequate lung expansion and transparency. These findings are consistent with the normal anatomic survey and metric-verified normal observations according to the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) standards.
