The chest X-ray image shows normal chest symmetry and bone structure alignment. No signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures are visible in the image. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are within normal limits, and the lung transparency gradients are consistent with normal lung tissue. The image is in agreement with the RSNA standards for technical factors, anatomic survey, metric-verified normal observations, and artifact notes.
