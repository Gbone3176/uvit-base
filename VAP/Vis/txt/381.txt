The chest X-ray demonstrates symmetric chest and bone structure alignment. There are no radiographic signs of pneumothorax, effusion, masses, or fractures. The clavicle-spine distance ratios are 0.79 and 0.81, and the lung transparency gradients are 4 and 4.5. These findings are consistent with normal observations according to the RSNA standards for chest X-ray reporting.
